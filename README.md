# MMEE_WLSM1
A recursive estimate algorithm is presented based on minimum model error principles and the weighted least squares method (WLSM).
 With the knowledge of measurements and measurement error covariance matrix, the method of solving two-point boundary value problems,
 invariant imbedding method, is adopted to derive the estimate algorithm,
 which recursively estimates the uncertainty errors and linear errors of discrete system or nonlinear system.
